### This project was built using the following

* HTML
* SCSS
* JavaScript
* JavaScript Libraries:
  * Webfont.js
  * Parallax.js
  * Masonry.js
  * jQuery.js
  * Slick.js
* Foundation Social Webicons

###

To get the website up and running you can clone this repo.

```git
git clone git@github.com:Asjas/Personal-Webpage.git
```

And then run the following commands.

This will start a local server on port `3000` that you can open to run a local version of my website.
